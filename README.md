👋 Hi, Im Todesstoss!

I am a Java Developer that has now experience of over 2 years. I am currently making a Report System, that is free on SpigotMC <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/100163/">[Click Here]</a>. If you have got any requests/ideas for more features for my report plugin, than you can do that by opening a <a href="https://github.com/TDSTOS/TDSTOS/pulls">Pull request</a>.
